# PyStruct

This is a managed structure implementation in Python 3 so that you don't have to rely on ctypes for structure definitions

This library is able to handle these data types:
* UInt8 / Int8 / byte / bool
* UInt16 / Int16 / ushort / short
* UInt32 / Int32 / int / uint / long / ulong
* UInt64 / Int64 / longlong / ulonglong
* Float32 / float / single
* Float64 / double
